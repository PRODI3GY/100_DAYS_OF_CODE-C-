# 100_DAYS_OF_CODE-C-

- I am attempting the 100-days-of-code challenge but in C while I document it out.

- Each day will have its own directory and a README.md file for that specific day in that directory.
 
- The README.md will contain the objectives for that day, things that I have learned and done from that day and the challenges faced.
