------DAY-6------SUMMARY

OBJECTIVES
1. Learn about functions.
2. Learn about arrays.
3. Learn about scanf.
4. Learn about user input.
5. Write 3 functions, one that takes variables as arguments, one that takes arrays as an argument, and one that does not take any argument.

WHAT I HAVE LEARNED AND DONE.
1. FUNCTIONS - Functions are blocks of code that contain instructions that are used to execute a specific task or a set of tasks.
             - One advantage of functions is re-usability, the function has to be created once but you can re-use it as many times as you can in your code by "calling" it. 
             - Calling a function simply means to summon a function. 
             - For example if your program requires that you need to add certain numbers after sometime, you can create a function that adds numbers then you can call it everytime your program needs to add numbers instead of re-writing code that adds numbers, this also causes your program to be neat and organized. 
             - When you create function you can make it a requirement that when someone calls the function, someone has to provide certain data so that the function can use that data to work, this is called specifying parameters and the data someone provides is known as an argument.
             - One can specify as many parameters as you want, parameters can be variables or even arrays.
             - The arguments that someone provides should be the same as the number of parameters specified.
             - It is not a must for a function to have parameters, it can just contain code to be executed and when the function is called it will not be must for one to give it arguments.
             - One can also specify the type of value that is to be returned after a function does it's job.
             - There is two parts when creating a function, there is the declaration and definition. When declaring the function you write the name of the function, the parameters and the return type the function should return.
             - When defining the function you write the code that is to be executed when someone summons the function.
             - It is recommended that one should separate the declaration and definition for code optimization but one can still be able to declare and define a function in the same place.
